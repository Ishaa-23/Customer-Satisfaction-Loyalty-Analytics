# Insights
* Age-Based Satisfaction & Loyalty
  * Satisfaction: Middle-aged customers report the highest satisfaction levels, while seniors express the lowest.
  * Loyalty: Despite lower satisfaction, seniors show the highest loyalty rates. Youth customers are the least loyal, although they represent only 11% of the customer base, which may influence this trend.
* Gender Distribution & Ratings Trends
  * The customer base comprises approximately 55% females and 45% males.
  * Notably high satisfaction ratings are clustered around scores 1, 10, followed by 2 and 5, suggesting a polarized customer experience.
* Purchase Behavior
  * Around 57% of customers are repeat purchasers, with key drivers including packaging quality, support availability, and product variety.
* Customer Group Dynamics
  * Group A (High-Frequency Buyers) who are one-time purchasers are evenly split between middle-aged and youth customers (50-50%).
  * Group B (Moderate-Frequency Buyers) with high loyalty and repeat purchases are predominantly seniors (57%), followed by middle-aged customers (29%).
* Support Experience & Loyalty Focus
  * A critical focus area is Group A customers with low loyalty who have engaged with support services. Their concerns primarily involve support availability, product features, and ease of use.
* Barriers to Repeat Purchases
  * The most cited reasons for one-time purchases are ease of use, delivery speed, and brand reputation.

# Recommendations
* Enhance Senior Experience (Low Satisfaction, High Loyalty)
  * Simplify product interfaces and improve accessibility features (e.g., larger fonts, guided setup).
* Engage Middle-Aged Customers (High Satisfaction, Mixed Loyalty)
  * Introduce loyalty programs and membership tiers that reward frequent engagement.
  * Personalize email/product recommendations using past purchase data.
* Re-engage Youth Segment (Low Loyalty, Low Share)
  * Use influencer marketing or gamified experiences to capture attention.
  * Offer student discounts or referral programs to attract more young customers.
* Improve Support for At-Risk Group A Customers
  * Monitor and follow up with these customers post-support interaction to restore trust.
* Address One-Time Buyer Pain Points
  * Optimize delivery logistics and clearly communicate expected delivery dates.
* Refine Customer Segmentation
  * Tailor engagement strategies and offers per segment rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
